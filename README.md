# smart-irrigation-system

This is an IoT system which automates the working of water motors in agriculture fields based on the moisture level in the soil helping farmers. Once installed, this system reduces the work of farmers and the chances of injuries.


The components required for this project are:
1. NodeMCU ESP8266
2. Soil Moisture Sensor
3. DHT11
4. Relay Module
5. Solenoid Water Valve
6. Breadboard


>>Download the Blynk app from the google play store/App Store. Add three widgets to the app(one each for displaying moisture, humidity and temperature of the soil.
change the wifi credentials along with the authentication id sent by the Blynk application to the registered email. Arrange the components as per the circuit diagram given and power the ESP8266 microcontroller.
